    - String, Boolean, Numerical

6. Explain Python Function?
    - Make programming more functional and modular to perform modular tasks
    - It helps to achieve code re-usability
    - Built-In Functions: len(), copy(), count()
    - User-defined Functions:

7. What is zip() function in Python?
    - Python zip() function returns a zip object
    - Which maps a similar index of multiple containers
    - Zip function takes n number of iterators
    - whichever has less lenght it will considered for mapping

8. What is Python's parameter passing mechanism?
    - Pass By Value: Passes an argument by value [Eg: a = 5]
    - Pass By Reference: Passes an argument by reference [Eg: list = ["a","b"]]

9. How to overload constructors or methods in Python?
    - We cannot overload constructors or methods in Python
    - Constructor: is called automatically when an object is created
    - Methods: will be called for the instance of an object

10. What is the difference between remove() function and del statement?
    - Use remove() - to delete specific object in the list [list.remove()]
    - del statement - used to delete object or delete a object in list [del list[0]]

11. What is swapcase() function in the Python?
    - Converts all characters to upper case to lower case and vice versa

12. How to remove whitespaces from a string in Python?
    - Use str strip() to remove whitespaces from a string

13. How to remove leading whitespaces from a string in the Python?
    - Use str lstrip() to remove whitespaces from a string

14. Why do we use join() function in Python?
    - It concatenates the string
    - String method
    - It concatenates the list or string with defined string

15. Give an example of shuffle() method?
    - random.shuffle()
    - This method shuffles the given array
    - It randomizes the items in the array

16. What is the use of break statement?
    - It is used to terminate the execution of the current loop.

17. What is tuple in Python?
    - Tuple is a built in data structure
    - Stores value in Sequence and value cannot be changed (Immutable)
    - it denoted by ()

18. Which are the file related libraries/modules in Python?
    - os and os.path - modules include a function for accessing the filesystem
    - shutil - module enables you to copy and delete the files

19. What are the different file processing modes supported by Python?
    - Read-only mode : Open a file for reading. It is the default mode.
    - Write-only mode: Open a file for writing. If the file contains data, data would be lost. Other a new file is created.
    - Read-Write mode: Open a file for reading, write mode. It means updating mode.
    - Append mode: Open for writing, append to the end of the file, if the file exists.

20. What is an operator in Python?
    - Unary [!, -]
    - Binary [+, - , /]
    - Ternary [?, :]
