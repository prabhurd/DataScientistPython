STATISTICS:

Sample or Population:
    - Sample [denoted by n] [n - statistics]
    - Population [denoted by N] [N - parameters]
    - Sample = (Randomness, Representatives)
    - parameters
    - statistics
    - Randomness
    - Representatives
    - Data Driven Decision

Types of Data:
    - Categorical
    - Numerical [Discrete, Continuous] - Main focus of statistics

Measurement Levels:
    - Qualitative [Nominal, Ordinal]
    - Quantitative [Interval, Ratio]

Categorical Data: Graph and Tables
    - Frequency Distribution Table
    - Bar Chart
    - Pie Chart
    - Pareto Diagram

Frequency Distribution Table:
    - [Interval Start, Interval End, Frequency, Relative Frequency]
    - Desired Interval (usually between 5 to 20)
    - Interval Width = (Largest Number - Smallest Number)/ Number of Desired Intervals
    - Relative Frequency = Frequency / Total Frequency
    - Absolute Frequency

Graphs and Tables for relationship between variables:

    - Side by Side Bar Chart
    - Scatter Plot (Very important for analysis)

Basics:
    - Population
